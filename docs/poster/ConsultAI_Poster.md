# ConsultAI: An Ethical Deliberation Framework for Medical Decision Making

## Introduction

ConsultAI is an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate ethical deliberation in complex medical scenarios. This state-of-the-art system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that simulates diverse healthcare perspectives, enabling comprehensive ethical analyses for challenging medical cases.

### Key Components

- **Multi-Agent System:** Integrates perspectives from attending physicians, nurse managers, ethicists, and patient advocates to ensure comprehensive coverage of all stakeholder viewpoints
- **Ethical Framework:** Built on core principles of medical ethics - autonomy, beneficence, justice, and resource allocation, providing a solid foundation for decision-making
- **Advanced LLM Integration:** Utilizes GPT-4 Turbo for sophisticated reasoning and natural language understanding, enabling nuanced ethical discussions
- **Structured Process:** Implements systematic deliberation protocols with defined rounds and consensus mechanisms for consistent and reliable outcomes

The system excels in analyzing complex medical ethics cases, providing evidence-based recommendations while maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the deliberation process. By combining cutting-edge AI technology with established medical ethics principles, ConsultAI serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, ethics committees, and medical institutions.

## Motivation

- Growing complexity in medical ethical decisions
- Need for systematic approach to ethical deliberation
- Limited availability of ethics committees
- Importance of considering multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Demand for rapid but thorough ethical analysis in time-sensitive situations
