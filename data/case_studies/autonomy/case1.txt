Title: Patient Autonomy in End-of-Life Care

Case Description:
A 78-year-old patient with advanced terminal cancer has clearly expressed their wish to discontinue treatment and return home for palliative care. However, their family members are insisting on continuing aggressive treatment, believing there's still hope for recovery. The patient is currently lucid and has decision-making capacity, but the family is pressuring both the patient and the medical team to continue with interventions.

Key Considerations:
1. Patient's right to autonomy and self-determination
2. Family's emotional involvement and concerns
3. Medical team's professional obligations
4. Quality of life versus length of life
5. Resource allocation implications

Medical Context:
- Stage 4 pancreatic cancer with multiple metastases
- Current treatment showing minimal effectiveness
- Significant pain and discomfort from treatments
- Estimated prognosis: 2-3 months with treatment, 1-2 months without

Patient's Perspective:
- Has expressed clear wishes to stop treatment
- Wants to spend remaining time at home
- Has completed advance directives
- Demonstrates full mental capacity

Family's Perspective:
- Believes more aggressive treatment could help
- Concerned about "giving up" on their loved one
- Willing to pay for additional treatments
- Emotionally struggling with acceptance

Questions for Deliberation:
1. How should the medical team balance patient autonomy with family wishes?
2. What are the ethical implications of continuing vs. discontinuing treatment?
3. How can the team best support both patient and family through this decision?
4. What role should resource allocation considerations play in this scenario?
